# Vectorised Genetic Algorithm
This program solves the traveling sales man problem by implementing a vectorised genetic algorithm.

## Inputs
- The path to a file containing names of cities (cities.csv)
- Number of generations
- Population size
- Mutation rate
- Crossover rate

## Outputs
- The shortest path found by this algorithm starting from the first city in the list of cities (path.csv)
- Visualisation of the shortest distance obtained in each generation of the genetic algorithm (performance.pdf)
